## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Angular 17
- Typescript
- Sass

### What I learned

Tried out using signals for state management, and new template expression syntax, just to stay up-to-dae with he new features and verisons of Angular.

### Continued development

Continue trying to implement signals, evaluating when to use observables vs signals. Also focus on what are good practices when it comes to signals.
